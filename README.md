# Hey There. This a simple blog app made using React and Tailwind CSS. 
<................................>
<h2>
  Right Now only frontend part is ready where you can see the home page as a introduction page, blog page in order to see the blogs, add blog page to add blogs, login/sign up page to register to login
</h2>
<.................................>
<h2> Backend part is in the development stages where I will be using Node.js/Express.js, Mongodb for database connection and JWT/bycrpt for authentication and authoraization. Basically, this project won't include admin pannel, only user pannel if they are registered and login then only they can add blogs....
