Hey There. This a simple blog app made using React and Tailwind CSS.
<................................>

Right Now only frontend part is ready where you can see the home page as a introduction page, blog page in order to see the blogs, add blog page to add blogs, login/sign up page to register to login
<.................................>

Backend part is in the development stages where I will be using Node.js/Express.js, Mongodb for database connection and JWT/bycrpt for authentication and authoraization. Basically, this project won't include admin pannel, only user pannel if they are registered and login then only they can add blogs....
